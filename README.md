Palm-PDB
========

Palm-PDB is a Perl distribution containing [Palm::PDB](https://metacpan.org/pod/Palm::PDB) and [Palm::Raw](https://metacpan.org/pod/Palm::Raw), a pair of Perl 5 modules for reading, manipulating, and writing the .pdb and .prc database files used by PalmOS devices such as the PalmPilot and its successors.

These 2 modules were historically part of the p5-Palm distribution, which is now just called [Palm](https://metacpan.org/release/Palm). They have been split off into their own distribution because they are also useful for manipulating the Mobipocket e-book format, which is also used for Amazon Kindle books. The modules remaining in the Palm distribution are only useful for accessing files from a PalmOS device.

This is a Git repository where development of Palm-PDB takes place.  For more information, visit [Palm-PDB on CPAN](https://metacpan.org/release/Palm-PDB).
