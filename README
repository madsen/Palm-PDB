Palm-PDB version {{$version}}, released {{$date}}

This distribution contains Palm::PDB and Palm::Raw, a pair of Perl 5
modules for reading, manipulating, and writing the .pdb and .prc
database files used by PalmOS devices such as the PalmPilot and its
successors.

These 2 modules were historically part of the p5-Palm distribution,
which is now just called Palm.  They have been split off into their
own distribution because they are also useful for manipulating the
Mobipocket e-book format, which is also used for Amazon Kindle books.
